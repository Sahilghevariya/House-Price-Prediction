# House Price Prediction with Synthetic Data 📈 🏘️

This project predicts house prices using a synthetically generated dataset. The model considers various features such as size, house type, city, area, number of rooms, and house age to estimate the property price. The pipeline includes data generation, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📌 Features

* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Randomly generates data for different house types, cities, areas, and features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Price distribution, correlation heatmap, and data summary.
* **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Scaling for numerical features and One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
* **Machine Learning Models:**

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
* **Performance Evaluation:** MSE, R² Score
* **Visualization:** Actual vs Predicted prices comparison.

## 📊 Dataset

The synthetic dataset includes:

* **Size:** House size in square feet
* **House Type:** Flat, Bungalow, Duplex, Triplex, Tenament
* **City:** Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Surat
* **Area:** Popular areas within each city
* **Rooms:** Number of rooms
* **Age:** Age of the house
* **Price:** Calculated based on multipliers and noise

Dataset is automatically saved as:

```
synthetic_house_prices.csv
```
